//Below is a template to make linking pages.
//Our goal for this morning is to get an application that uses buttons, text, Style, and view to move from one page to another
//As we discussed the first day, many of our applications are comprised of just a series of buttons
//As we learned with HTML, CSS, and JS, the websites we visit and applications we use are really just a basic framework with lots of style added to it
//Everyone of your applications in someway involves the button component, and the changing of pages
//Take the code below, and try and adapt it so that you have an application that can move between different screens.
//This application should serve as an 'early-stage' of your final applications that you all are hoping to design
//Make sure to think of the user experience
//Once you have completed this task, please move on to demo 2.

import { Button, View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { createStackNavigator, createAppContainer } from 'react-navigation';
//to install react-navigation you can use npm install --save react-navigation

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>

        //insert content for homescreen here

        <Button
          title="Go to Page2"
          onPress={() => this.props.navigation.navigate('Page2')}//navigate to 'Page2' //the text in green should match the part in red on the section that says createAppContainer
        /> //use this button text to create your linkage from one page to another
      </View>
    );

  render() {

    Page2: Page2Screen, //should match what you are referring to as Page2

  //add any additional pages here. be sure the info matches how you are using them above
  },
  {
    initialRouteName: 'Home', //here you declare what the initial loaded page should be
  }

//here is where the actual rendering happens. There is nothing more that you need to do here
